        <p> The children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and
            the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together
            quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous play. and their talk was still of
            the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. <general playID="LA"

            and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the smoothest and roundest
            stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix-- the villagers pronounced this name
            "Dellacroy"--eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and
            guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside, talking among
            themselves, looking over their shoulders at rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of
            their older brothers or sisters. </p>
